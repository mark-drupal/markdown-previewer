This is a simple markdown previewer program.  Essentially its a text box which displays whatever is typed into it in a window below.

The idea is that if the user uses Markdown script (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) it will be converted into HTML.
This allows them to preview what they have typed.

This project formed a part of the freecodecamp.com front end libaries projects.  Details you can find here:

There is a script (I guess automated testing) which checks the program to ensure it meets the requirements.  You will see this as a menu
on the top left hand side when the page renders.
